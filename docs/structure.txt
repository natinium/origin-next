## Explanation:

-   **`app/`**: This directory is managed by Next.js and is used for defining routes and pages.
    -   `api/`: Contains API route handlers.
    -   `layout.tsx`: The root layout for the entire application.
    -   `page.tsx`: The home page component.
-   **`components/`**: This directory holds all reusable UI components.
    -   `ui/`: Contains primitive UI components like buttons, inputs, and other basic building blocks.
    -   `shared/`: Contains components that are shared across multiple features.
    -   `feature/`: Contains components that are specific to a particular feature.
-   **`contexts/`**: This directory stores React contexts for managing global state.
-   **`hooks/`**: This directory contains custom React hooks.
-   **`lib/`**: This directory houses utility functions and helper modules.
    -   `utils.ts`: General utility functions.
    -   `api.ts`: An API client for making requests to external APIs.
-   **`styles/`**: This directory contains global styles and CSS modules.
    -   `globals.scss`: Global styles for the application.
-   **`types/`**: This directory holds TypeScript type definitions.
-   **`utils/`**: This directory contains utility functions and helper modules.

This structure promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to scale and manage the application over time.
